The sticky navigation bar serves the purpose of keeping the navigation menu fixed at the top of the viewport as the users scroll down the page. Benefits of having the naviation bar include accessability; it remains visable to users at all times, and potentially increased engagement as easy access to the navation bar encourages users to stay on the site longer and interact with other pages.

There is a large introduction with my name and photo on the site's landing page. This will hopefully establish and reinforce my personal brand and create a lasting and memorable first impression on users.

The contact forms appear at the bottom of the landing page and on the contacts page. Having a contact form facilitates direct communcation between users and the website owner. It also makes it convenient for users to message directly from the websit as opposed to opening their email client and composing an email.

* <b> Headings (text component)</b>

Headings provide a clear structure to the content, making the flow of information easy to understand for the users. Headings also allow for better accessability as they allow for visually impaired users to understand what page they are on.

Buttons are included throughout the website. They allow enhanced user experience as they feel interactive and guide users to take specific actions, such as submitting a form and viewing my CV. They also allow users to differenciate the buttons from other elements quickly.
<br>
* <b>Images (graphical component)</b>

There are images placed throughout the website. The images have a zoom effect when users hover over them. This adds an interative element to the website, making it more engaging for users. The zoom effect also aid in drawing attention of users to important visuals and makes the site feel more responsive and intuitive.
<br>

* <b>Animated Icons (graphical component)</b>

Having animated icons add visual appeal to the website; they make the website more visually interesting and engaging. Animated icons are typically lightweight, leading to faster loading times compared to large image files or external libraries. CSS animations also have the benefit of being scalable as they are vector-based, meaning they will not lose their quality if the sizing is changed, which is great for responsive web design.

<br>
* <b>Footer (graphical component)</b>

![Footer](./docs/Screenshot-Footer.png)

The footer will be located at the bottom of every page. It will contain icons that will link to LinkedIn, Github and my email address. The footer provides a consistent place for users to find important links, which ease naviagtion and allow for quick access to important destinations.
