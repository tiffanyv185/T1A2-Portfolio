## Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this online web portfolio is to showcase my skills and capabalities regarding web devlopement to potential future employers. 

### Functionality and features
Each page will have a sticky navigation bar on the top header. The navigation bar will have links to all pages of the website.
The pages include Home, About, Projects, Blog and Contacts.

Throughout the website, there will be <b> components </b> including:

* Sticky navigation bar (text component)
![Navigation Bar](Screenshot-Nav-Bar.png)
The sticky navigation bar serves the purpose of keeping the navigation menu fixed at the top of the viewport as the users scroll down the page. Benefits of having the naviation bar include accessability; it remains visable to users at all times, and potentially increased engagement as easy access to the navation bar encourages users to stay on the site longer and interact with other pages.

There is a large introduction with my name and photo on the site's landing page. This will hopefully establish and reinforce my personal brand and create a lasting and memorable first impression to users.
